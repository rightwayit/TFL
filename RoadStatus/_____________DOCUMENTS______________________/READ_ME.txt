For TFL readers:

This project was developed using Rightway IT's own BDD framework (not supplied owing to IP considerations).

You should nevertheless find that the Web client works OK, as it has been verified via this framework.

If you require a Selenium test too, please get in touch and I'll port our BDD code to Selenium for you.

No doubt you by now have plenty of Selenium test suites for this scenario. Please use them for the time being.


Technical Note(s):

The code has been partly decomposed into SRP classes as an incomplete SOLID/DRY demo.

There are few/no comments, as it is company policy to write more or less readable code using Beck constructs such as Explaining method.

More validation is possible, but time prevents this.

Please call anytime to discuss 01440 707720.
